# Civic-Initiative

Look up your representatives and learn something about them while you're at it.

## Description

The purpose of this web application is to provide a variety of resources that help people understand who their representatives are and what they do.

If you do not know the names of the people who represent you in your local government, you can search for them using your address. You will be provided with their name, title, the branch of government they are associated with, any phone numbers or addresses listed from google civic info, as well some links to various resources available about them.

Some resources may include; news articles that reference that representative, their Facebook page, their Youtube page, their official website, their local wiki page.

There are a lot of great resources out there for learning about your representative, however the Civic Initiative remains a great place to start for learning more about the people that represent you.

## Deployment



## Alpha testing is GO!

I have got the bare minimum application deployed.

The link to this application can be found [here](https://civic-initiative.herokuapp.com/).

I have basically set up the bare minimum features I set out to set up for this project. There are still a number of ways this application can be improved. For instance I would love to set up more links to the [Local Wiki]() project, or possibly link the representatives title to an appropriate wikipedia page.

These are just some examples of what could be small quality of life updates that could make the information more accessible to someone whose has little to no knowledge about the people that represent them in government.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or constructive criticism, I can be reached at my email address.

I'd like to give a shout out to the [Local Wiki]() project. They have a lot of great information and links to various political representatives and I hope to incorporate more references to their project when I get the chance.
