# Civic-Initiative

Look up your representative and do some research on them while your at it.

## Work in progress

This application is currently under construction.

The plan is to set up a UI interfacing the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and [Google Civic Information](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/).

Basically, you'll look up your representatives using your address. You will then be able to look up various articles about the representative with the click of a button, or that's the plan anyways.

## Alpha testing is GO!

I have got the bare minimum application deployed.

The link to this application can be found [here](https://civic-initiative.herokuapp.com/).

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or constructive criticism, I can be reached at my email address.

I am not excepting contributions to this project at this point in time. I'd like to fix some of the issues I've found first. Once I'm satisfied with the work I've done, I'll reconsider this policy.
