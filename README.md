# Civic-Initiative

Look up your representative and do some research on them while your at it.

## Work in progress

This application is currently under construction.

The plan is to set up a UI interfacing the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and [Google Civic Information](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/).

Basically, you'll look up your representatives using your address. You will then be able to look up various articles about the representative with the click of a button, or that's the plan anyways.
